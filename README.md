# 🎨 Color Theme Switcher (React)

This small React app lets you switch between multiple color themes:

- Light  
- Dark  
- Blue  
- Green  

## 🧠 What I learned
- useState for managing the selected theme  
- Mapping over arrays to generate buttons  
- Dynamic className based on state  
- CSS theme switching  

## 🚀 How it works
Click any theme button → The app changes its class → CSS updates the colors instantly.
